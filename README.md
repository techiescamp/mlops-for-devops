# MLOps for DevOps Engineers

A hands-on, project-based guide to Machine Learning Operations built specifically for DevOps, Platform, and SRE engineers.

> No ML background required. Every concept is explained through DevOps analogies you already understand.

If you are completely new to MLOps, read our [DevOps to MLOps guide](https://devopscube.com) first.

## Who This Is For

Most MLOps resources are written for data scientists learning infrastructure. This repo flips that.

You do not need to become a data scientist. But just like understanding how a Java application is built makes you a better DevOps engineer, understanding how an ML model is built, trained, and served makes you effective at operating ML workloads in production.

## What We Build

| Track | What You Learn |
|-------|----------------|
| 🤖 Traditional ML | Train, serve, automate, and monitor a real ML model on Kubernetes |
| 🧠 Foundational Models | Serve LLMs in production using vLLM, TGI, and Ollama |
| ⚙️ LLM-Powered DevOps | Monitor K8s clusters, build RAG pipelines and agents with LLMs |

Everything runs on Kubernetes, Docker, and tools you already use.

## Prerequisites

| Skill | Level |
|-------|-------|
| Linux CLI | Intermediate |
| Docker | Intermediate |
| Kubernetes | Intermediate |
| AWS | Basic to Intermediate |
| Python | Basic — read and run scripts |
| Git | Intermediate |

No ML experience needed. That is what this repo teaches.

## Phase 1: Local Development & Data Pipelines

**Goal:** Build the full ML foundation on your local machine — from raw data to a trained, tested model.

**Use case throughout:** Employee attrition prediction for a large organisation (~500,000 employees). One problem, end to end. Keeps the focus on infrastructure and operations, not data science theory.

| Step | Title | Guide |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Project Dataset Pipeline | [Read the Guide](#) |
| 2 | Data Preparation Stages | [Read the Guide](#) |
| 3 | Training & Building the Prediction Model | [Read the Guide](#) |
| 4 | From Model to Live API with KServe | 🔜 Coming this Saturday |
